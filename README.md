## Project Synopsis
A realtime chat application to be connected with the Tarvn capstone project.
Users can register, login, and send messages to other users within different groups.

** Please use the SwiftChat.xcworkspace file to run the project! **

## Project Status
* We have implemented an API to save and retrieve messages and display them in real-time. 
* The user can enter a group name and see the messages saved for each individual group.
* We have also designed the initial user interface for the login page, register page, and chat messenger in the group.
* We implemented a local database for storing usernames and passwords for authentication.
